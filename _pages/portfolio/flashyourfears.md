Face your nightmares in this spooky 2D Unity survival game in which you fight ghosts only using your flashlight!  

It was developed by me and three other friends in **only one week** for [Brackeysâ€™ Game Jam 2022.1. following the theme "It Is Not Real"](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7).

As I was the member with the most gamedev and programming experience, I was the **director, lead designer (environment, level, audio...), VFX artist and lead programmer** of the game.

In Flash Your Fears, you play as Gwen, a brave girl armed with a flashlight on a quest to find her friend Boo in a haunted house.  Banish the creatures of the night by revealing their true nature â€“ they're only figments of your imagination! But beware, if the ghosts linger too long, your fear will consume you...

Key Features:
- **Unique Gameplay**: Defeat ghosts with the power of your flashlight!
- **Challenging Encounters**: Face diverse enemies and intense boss battles.
- **Power-Ups**: Discover helpful items to aid your quest.
- **Immersive Story**: Unravel the secrets of the haunted house through cutscenes and dialogue.
- **Charming Pixel Art**: Experience a beautifully crafted world.
And more!

It's a pretty short game and I built it using Unity WebGL, so **play it now right here!*^*
