Flash Your Fears is a **Unity Survival 2D game** in which you fight ghosts using only your flashlight!

It was developed by me and three other friends in **only one week** for [Brackeysâ€™ Game Jam 2022.1. following the theme "It Is Not Real"](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7).

As back then I was the member with the most gamedev and programming experience, I was the **director, lead designer (environment, level, audio...), VFX artist and lead programmer** of the game.

In Flash Your Fears you play as Gwen, a small girl that has to explore a haunted house to find her friend Boo. Gwen can use Mark's flashlight to (literally) flash her fears and discover that the ghosts that haunt the house only exist in her imagination. As Gwen flashes the ghosts, they'll slowly disappear until she discovers that they are not real. But be careful! If the ghosts end up touching Gwen or being near her for too long, her Level of Fear (LoF bar on the left) will rise until she can take it any more. If she gets through the whole house, she'll find the scary truth behind the haunted house...

Flash Your Fear counts with different enemy types, challenging boss fights, power ups, challenging enemy waves, dialogue system, cutscenes, a beautiful pixelart... An much more!

It's a pretty short game and I built it using Unity WebGL, so try it out here!
