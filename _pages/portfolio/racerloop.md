Worked on Racerloop, a PC arcade racing game. Made with Unity. Developed by a
small team where I had to work both under lead directions and on my own.
Contributions in: AI, Synchronous Online Game Mode, Gameplay Systems, Automated Tests, Math Scripts and other topics.

Worked on:
- AI Players: Movement, tracking, obstacle avoidance, gameplay systems, ideal racing
lane, AI skill, fine tunning...
- Synchronous Online Game Mode: Menu, lobby, remote connection, player position,
race progress, AI players and power up sync, reconnection...
- PlayFab: Implementation of PlayFabâ€™s server login, user save and load along with
their statistics, global leaderboards...
- Gameplay Systems: Player Orbital Camera with Spring Damper System, Shipâ€™s hovering, Power Ups, Debug Renderer, AbstractInputs...
- Testing Automation: Automatic Testing of the game using Unity Test Framework.
- UI: Login, Leaderboards, Online and Lobby screens, as well as a general pop up error
window.
- Math Utils: Several math scripts for needs such as working with 2D lines or projected positions.
- Offline Build: Worked on adapting back-end services from the server into the file
system. Just for events with no internet connection.
- Simple VFX: Simple shaders and particles.
