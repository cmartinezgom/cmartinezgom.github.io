# About me

Hi! I'm Carlos Mart√≠nez, a programmer, designer and gamer from Spain! I have been playing videogames since I was little, and they ended up being the main focus of my life, both professionally and personally. I have spent the last +10 years creating and learning about them!

## Education

I am a Computer Science graduate with a Master's in Video Game Design and Programming. I've also studied abroad for one semester at CSUMB (California, USA) during my Computer Science BCs, and this was my first direct experience with gamedev outside of several courses. I'm bilingual, as I've studied in English since I was 3 years old, up to taking the IGCSE exams at highschool. During my Baccaularate in Science and Technology, I graduated with honors.

I am also a musician, a self-taught video creator and editor, a Certified Recreational Activities Coordinator...

## Experience

My professional experience spans over 2-3 years of programming. My most recent work was as a Junior Programmer at Maniac Panda Games developing Racerloop, where I worked on the AI, online game mode, gameplay, UI and more. And I also was a Software Engineering Intern at HP-SCDS, where I developed the MotionTracker project: a Python-based motion tracking app that worked with the camara in movement.
You can check them in more detail my [portfolio](/portfolio)!
You'll also find there several personal and educational projects, both about programming and design, and some small modding project I've developed.

## Hobbies

I mainly play and learn about videogames, but I also love to read, play basketball and hang out with my friends!
